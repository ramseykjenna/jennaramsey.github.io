#Week One: The Iron Yard
##Brain Overload

#####This week has been exhilerating! I've learned so much in such a short amount of time and that feels really great. Even though I've been getting a lot less sleep than usual, I have felt so energized and excited throughout the past few days. It's crazy because a few months ago I had never even heard of github but now I've already made several commits! I'm writing a freaking blogpost with Markdown! Even though every last second has been major brain overload to where it feels like my brain literally hurts, I'm happy because I'm already starting to visualize myself in a great job doing this fun stuff every day!! 

#####Perhaps one of the best things I can take away from this week is what I learned from watching the video about Leonardo Davinci. Basically, Leonardo was considered a loser back in his day for quite some time. It wasn't until he was 46 years old that he had his big break with _The Last Supper_ painting. Sometimes I get discouraged because I feel like I'm so far from becoming that amazing web designer, or frustrated because I thought I would have a successful career by now, but it's encouraging to realize that someone like Leonardo Davinci, who we all consider to be a boss painter, probably felt the same way back in his day.

#####I'm hoping to catch up on some sleep sometime soon, but overall I am really stoked about the direction my life is taking and about everything I've learned so far this week!
